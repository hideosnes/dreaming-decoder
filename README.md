# Dreaming Decoder
Self-host your Podcast (WIP). Made with Svelte5, Tailwind and using Pocketbase as a backend, so you can self-host podcasts.
This project is currently under activ development. Until the project reached a certain grade of maturity (~V0.0.8) it is (!)*NOT*(!) recommended to use in production.

## Contributing
I'm unsure why or how you could contribute at this stage. In any case:
* If you've got an idea (&& you are able to code it), create an issue and we can talk about it.
* AI generated code is fairly alright as long as you declare it as such. Unwarranted requests will be deleted.
* If you've got a feature wish (&& you can't code it by yourself), use the Wiki.
* Consult the Wiki if you've got questions and the answer isn't among the following:

1) It will be open-source
2) It will feature AI
3) If it can be federated, it will be federated
4) With a free MIT-license
5) Currently I'm not open for new projects
6) that includes your podcast/product/idea
